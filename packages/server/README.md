**WARNING: THIS LIBRARY IS IN ALPHA -- A WORK IN PROGRESS -- USAGE AT YOUR OWN RISK**

Until version 1.0.0, the API is subject to breaking changes without a major version bump. This is not meant for production use by external users yet. Rather it is an internal project that is being developed in the open.

# Fine-grained authorization

Primary package for using Kilpi authorization. Create a subject, a set of rules and protect functions with `Kilpi.getPermission`, `Kilpi.protect` or `Kilpi.createProtectedQuery`. Also includes many more useful features.
